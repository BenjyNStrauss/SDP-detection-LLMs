# SDP-detection-LLMs
Dataset used in Paper

Contained within are the 50 classes, enums, and interfaces analyzed.

To use the Java Anonymizer:

(0) Copy JavaAnonymizerStandalone into your project, change the package declaration

(1) When creating the object, provide it with a list of Strings that you don't want anonymized

(2) Split code into a format where each line is a string and run it through anonymizer

Output will be in the same format as the input.

The LLM output parser standalone has not been tested.  Place files in a directory "analysis" before running.  If bugs occur, please email benjynstrauss@gmail.com with the stack trace.
